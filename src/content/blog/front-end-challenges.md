Some notes from the interminably long article, grandly titled [The Front End Developer/Engineer Handbook 2024](https://frontendmasters.com/guides/front-end-handbook/2024/).

Somehow, I actually skimmed through the skeletal "handbook" that covers a lot of ground with a lot of bullet points.

Some interesting bullet points:

Chellenges:

_The Front-end Divide_: the growing split between JavaScript-centric programming and html-css centric ui/x programming

_Technology churn_: the rapid evolution and turnover of technologies, frameworks, and tools makes it daunting

_Web compatiblity / Cross-platform development/ Responsive Design & Adaptive Design Development_: Build applications for different browsers/platforms can be a frustration time-consuming experience

_Complexity_: Web development, tools, technologies are becoming more and more complex with many tradeoffs

> We have accepted too much in the realm of complexity and forfeited our attention to less important matters. We are now somewhat stuck in a time of being all things and nothing.
