INP has been around for a few years. INP, as an official metric, has replaced FID (First Input Delay) and used as one of the three core web vitals weleded by Google as a tie breaker in determining how search results are ranked and served to users.

Next JS has not been performing well in the competiion of core web vitals. The industry (whatever it means) seems to have to realize the terrible flaws of rendering a web page through server side first then subsequently "hydrating" them with the result JavaScript code. Whether it is in response to the poor showings in web performance metrics or the realization of inefficiency of the traditional next js, vercel, next js creator, introduced a new coding paradigm. They call it app router, as opposed the tradtional page router.

App router is complete break from the old next js page router. It is like Augular js 1.x to Augular 2.x. Same package, completely different content.

With that, all our code breaks too.

Humpty dumpty had a great fall.

...

I have been wondering how exactly next js app router been performing.

I eventually from the [data and charts](https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/55bc8fad-44c2-4280-aa0b-5f3f0cd3d2be/page/[â€¦]580Next.js%25EE%2580%2580Next.js%2520App%2520Router%22%7D) in the very giant data pit http archive.

Though i did not know, so i set out to learn about http archive and i learned how to query the CWV metrics for a technology I care.

The result is the following query:

```
CREATE TEMP FUNCTION IS_GOOD(good FLOAT64, needs_improvement FLOAT64, poor FLOAT64) RETURNS BOOL AS (
good / (good + needs_improvement + poor) >= 0.75
);

CREATE TEMP FUNCTION IS*NON_ZERO(good FLOAT64, needs_improvement FLOAT64, poor FLOAT64) RETURNS BOOL AS (
good + needs_improvement + poor > 0
);
